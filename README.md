# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help HR departments proactively identify employees at risk of leaving, based on historical data and key behavioral and demographic factors.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `EDA and Preprocessing`: Analyzing data distributions, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- `Model Building`: Training Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- `Evaluation`: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- `Visualization`: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize feature importance and correlations.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Performed detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns influencing attrition.
- Engineered relevant features and applied preprocessing techniques for better model performance.
- Built and compared multiple classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Used visualizations to interpret relationships between features like job satisfaction, overtime, and monthly income.
- Achieved solid accuracy and actionable insights for HR decision-making.

## 📈 Results

- The Random Forest model achieved better overall performance in predicting attrition.
- Identified key factors contributing to attrition such as overtime, job satisfaction, and environment satisfaction.
- Demonstrated how predictive analytics can enhance employee retention strategies.
